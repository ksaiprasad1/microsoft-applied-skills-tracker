| --- | --- | --- |
| **Focus** | Scenario-based, specific tasks | Role-based, comprehensive |
| **Types** | Technical & Business | Fundamentals, Role-based, Expert, Specialty |
| **Time to Prep** | 4-5 hours (typical) | 20+ hours |
| **Assessment** | Interactive lab (2 hours) | Multiple choice exam (varies) |
| **Cost** | FREE | $99-$165 per exam |
| **Format** | Hands-on, task-based | Knowledge-based exam |
| **Expiration** | Never expires | Annual renewal required |
| **Scope** | Narrow, targeted (1 skill) | Broad, role-encompassing (4-6 skill areas) |
| **Best For** | Project-specific skills, quick validation | Career advancement, job roles |
| **Results** | Minutes to 24 hours | Immediate |

**Both are valuable!** Applied Skills complement certifications and can help prepare for them. Many professionals earn both.
