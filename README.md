## 🎯 Assessment Tips

### General Preparation
- **Time Requirement**: Each assessment typically takes 2 hours

### Success Strategies
1. **Complete Learning Paths**: Finish the official learning path before attempting
2. **Practice in Sandboxes**: Use free Azure/M365 sandboxes for hands-on practice
